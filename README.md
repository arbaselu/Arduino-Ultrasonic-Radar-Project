Arduino Ultrasonic Radar Project 
Description
This project enables you to build a functional ultrasonic radar using Arduino. It's designed to detect nearby objects and visualize them, providing an excellent way to learn about ultrasonic sensors, servo motor control, and Arduino programming.

Required Components
Arduino Board (Uno, Nano, etc.)
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)
Servo Motor
LCD Display (optional)
Buzzer (optional)
Breadboard
Jumper Wires
Resistors (for LEDs)
Power Supply (battery or USB cable for Arduino)

Circuit Schematic
The circuit schematic can be found in the project files. Please refer to this document for detailed wiring and component setup.

Source Code
The source code can be found in the radar_code.ino file in this repository. Ensure you adjust the parameters according to your setup and components.

Assembly and Usage Instructions

Component Assembly: Connect all components according to the circuit schematic.

Programming the Arduino: Load the source code onto your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

Testing: After loading the code, test the radar to ensure it's working correctly.

Debugging: If you encounter any issues, review your connections and source code for possible errors.
